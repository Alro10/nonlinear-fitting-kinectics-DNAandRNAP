# nonlinear-fitting-kinectics-DNAandRNAP
Nonlinear regression using to estimate kinetics constants of DNA promoter opening and escape during transcription initiation complex assembled between Lambda PR promoter and E. coli RNA polymerase. Based on [Kinetics of promoter escape by bacterial RNA polymerase: effects of
promoter contacts and transcription bubble collapse](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263709791_Kinetics_of_promoter_escape_by_bacterial_RNA_polymerase_Effects_of_promoter_contacts_and_transcription_bubble_collapse)
